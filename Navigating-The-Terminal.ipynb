    "# Navigating The Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture focuses on the Terminal, an essential software development tool in Windows and macOS. Understanding how to use the Terminal effectively is crucial for executing commands and managing files, regardless of the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in Terminal Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Shell vs. The Terminal Emulator\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Shell**: A command interpreter, like Bash in Unix/Linux systems and PowerShell in Windows.\n",
    "- **The Terminal Emulator**: Applications like Git Bash on Windows or Terminal on macOS provide shell access.\n",
    "- **Naming Overlap**: Sometimes, the terminal emulator and the shell may share names, but their functions are distinct.\n",
    "- **Naming Overlap Examples**:\n",
    "   - **Git Bash (Emulator) and Bash (Shell)**: In Windows, Git Bash is the terminal emulator that provides access to the Bash shell.\n",
    "    - **PowerShell (Both)**: The term \"PowerShell\" is commonly used to refer to both the shell itself and the terminal emulator (known as the PowerShell Console) in Windows.\n",
    "   - **Terminal (Emulator) and Bash (Shell) on macOS**: The macOS Terminal is the emulator through which users access the ZSH shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Paths and Their Relevance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Absolute Paths**: Specify an exact location from the root, such as `/Users/username/Documents` on macOS or `C:\\Users\\username\\Documents` on Windows.\n",
    "- **Relative Paths**: Paths relative to the current directory. For instance, if you have an image in your project's `media/` folder and are currently at the project root, the relative path to the image would be `media/image.jpg`.\n",
    "- **Using `pwd`**: This command is vital for understanding your current directory's path, which is crucial for relative imports and file referencing in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding SUDO\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose of SUDO**: In Unix-like systems, it executes commands with administrative privileges.\n",
    "- **Relevance for Windows Users**: In Git Bash, `sudo` is not emulated. Run Git Bash as an administrator for similar functionality.\n",
    "- **Relevance for macOS Users**: `sudo` can be used in macOS for tasks requiring higher permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminal: Basic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Navigation and File Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pwd`: Prints the current directory's path."
